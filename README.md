# Lyft Rides Data Analysis (IN PROGRESS)

Analyzing Lyft data to draw potential insights about driver and rides patterns. Insights include questions that could be of use to Lyft to improving its rides experience.

## Introduction

There are a couple of reasons I am fond of Lyft. Most recently, the biggest one is its scooter pricing. At UCLA, Lyft scooters are convenient to move around with. Cheaper than Birds and more abundant than Limes and Ubers, I'm always on the prowl for Lyft scooters if I'm late to class to returning from a friend's place late at night. The second reason is that I have noticed that its shared rides are usually more inexpensive than Ubers, and if one adds up their rides, they could actually find themselves saving a decent amount on ride-sharing.

As both a rider and from a business perspective, I want to analyze this data set to draw insights about the Lyft experience for riders and drivers, and potential business opportunities for Lyft.
